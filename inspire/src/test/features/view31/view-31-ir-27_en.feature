Feature: Requirement 27
  INSPIRE is more demanding than **ISO 19115** by mandating both the name of the organisation, and a contact e-mail 
  address. The role of the responsible party serving as a metadata point of contact is out of scope of the Metadata 
  Regulation **INS MD**, but this property is mandated by **ISO 19115**. Its value shall be defaulted to “pointOfContact”.
  !!!
  Requirement established in the guidance document [Technical Guidance for the
  implementation of INSPIRE View Services Version 3.1](http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/Network_Services/TechnicalGuidance_ViewServices_v3.1.pdf) 
  for **view services** based on the international standard **ISO 19128**
  (**OGC WMS 1.3.0**). The applicable legislation is the [Commission Regulation (EC) nº 976/2009 (amended by Commission Regulation (EU)
  nº 1088/2010)](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2009R0976:20101228:EN:HTML).
